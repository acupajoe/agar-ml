## Machine Learning using agar.io

To get started with showing how this works:

```
yarn install
yarn run build
yarn run neat
```

Settings can be adjusted in the source under `./src/{algorithm}/settings.js`. If settings are adjusted
the page needs to be refreshed and `yarn run build` should be run again.

Outputs are saved (for `neat`) in the parent directory of this project under `../training-samples`.
